# DynamicsProject
This project was for my Analytical Mechanics: Dynamics class. We were tasked with exploring a dynamic system that we didn't cover in depth in class. I choose double and triple pendulums for my topic as they are a create example of a chaotic system.

How to Run:

When the main is called, the user is prompted to input a number. The options are printed in the terminal.

1. Wave Pendulum - where multiple uncoupled pendulums of varying lengths can create amazing patterns when placed together.
2. Single Pendulum - a dynamic structure consisting of an arm and mass located at the end of the arm.
3. Double Pendulum - 2 single pendulums coupled together which creates chaotic motion.
4. Triple Pendulum - 3 single pendulums coupled together which creates the ultimate representation of chaos theory.
5. All in One - the final product, combines the single, double, and triple pendulums to one application. 
   
UI: 

The buttons allow the user to control what type of pendulum is active, the color, and the number of pendulums viewable. 

The Future?: 

I hope to further optimize the program, as it takes quite a bit to start when first opened. I also plan to allow the user to personally change many if not all of the variable that affect the chaotic motion of the pendulums. Examples include the timestep, initial angles, initial velocities, mass of each "mass", as well as the length of each arm.
