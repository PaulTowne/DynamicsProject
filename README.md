# DynamicsProject
This project was for my Analytical Mechanics: Dynamics class. We were tasked with exploring a dynamic system that we didn't cover in depth in class. I choose double and triple pendulums for my topic as they are a create example of a chaotic system.

How to Run:

When the main is called, the user is prompted to input a number. Enter "5" in order to run the simulation. Other numbers refer to test runs that I used to test various functions. 

UI: 

The buttons allow the user to control what type of pendulum is active, the color, and the number of pendulums viewable. 

The Future?: 

I hope to further optimize the program, as it takes quite a bit to start when first opened. I also plan to allow the user to personally change the initial angles and velocities of each pendulum.
